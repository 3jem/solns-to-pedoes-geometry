#+title: Solutions to Exercises 0.7 to 0.13 of Pedoe's Geometry

* 0.7
\begin{align*}
&(1 + i)^2 \\
&= (\sqrt{2}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i))^2 \\
&= (\sqrt{2} (\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + i \sin(\frac{\pi}{4})))^2 \\
\textrm{By De Moivre's theorem} \\
&= 2(\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) + i \sin(\frac{\pi}{2})) \\
&= 2i
\end{align*}

From above it can be seen that the modulus is 2, amplitude is \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).
